Out of the given options:\n\nA. new mexico - It's a state in the US, not a specific location where a lizard would commonly surprise someone.\n\nB. forrest - This seems to be a misspelling of \"forest\". Although forests are natural habitats for lizards, they are vast and not always places where people frequently visit or get surprised by lizards.\n\nC. dessert - This is actually a sweet course served at the end of a meal. The correct spelling for a dry, arid region is \"desert\". But even if we consider the intended meaning as \"desert\", while lizards do live in deserts, they are not as likely to surprise people there as in more populated or frequented areas.\n\nD. garden - Gardens are places where lizards often hide and seek food. People frequently visit gardens, and lizards can easily surprise them by suddenly appearing from behind plants or rocks.\n\nE. creek - Creeks are small streams of water. While some lizard species might be found near water sources, they are not as common there as in other habitats, and less",

Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. person - Humans are known for their capacity to care for others, show empathy, and have a sense of compassion. A \"caring heart\" is often used to describe someone who is kind, considerate, and sympathetic. Therefore, this option is highly suitable.\n\nB. species - This option refers to a group of organisms that can interbreed to produce fertile offspring. It's a broad term that doesn't specifically indicate whether the species has a caring heart or not. Some species might, but not all.\n\nC. artichoke - It seems like there might be a typo here, as \"artichoke\" is not a commonly recognized word. If it's meant to be \"artichoke\" (which is not a standard word) or a similar-sounding word like \"artichoke\" (which is a type of plant), it doesn't fit the context of having a caring heart. Plants don't have emotions or the capacity to care.\n\nD. all mammals - Mammals are a broad group of animals that include humans, primates, cats, dogs, whales,",

The other options don't accurately describe the untreated glass in this context. \"Weak\" can refer to a variety of things，including physical strength，but \"fragile\" is more specific to materials that are easily broken. \"Forceless\" refers to a lack of physical strength or power，which doesn't directly describe the glass itself. \"Regular\" means normal or usual，which doesn't convey the fragility of untreated glass. \"Flimsy\" means thin and weak，but \"fragile\" is a more precise term for glass that is prone to breaking. Therefore，\"fragile\" is the most appropriate answer.",

A walrus is a large marine mammal, and it cannot be powered by an electric motor or be multi-coloured in a natural sense.\n\nD. electric refrigerator - An electric refrigerator is a common household appliance that is powered by an electric motor.
